# About this project
This is a very simple Python-based chatbot using Hugging Face's Transformers and Facebook's BlenderBot.

This project involved the creation of a chatbot utilizing open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on delivering human-like conversational capabilities. Leveraging the powerful Hugging Face Transformers library, I implemented Facebook's BlenderBot model to understand and generate responses that mimic human conversation. The core functionality centered around tokenization, input processing, and response generation, ensuring the chatbot could handle ongoing dialogues with context awareness. The implementation was crafted to handle the intricacies of natural language understanding and generation, making the chatbot robust and responsive.
